        <h5>Head Coach & Skill Development</h5>
        <p>With a lifelong love for basketball, I founded the Concrete Jungle Basketball Program. I started my journey as a player at Maple Ridge Secondary School and made my way to Columbia Bible College to play post-secondary, 
            where I earned my stripes as a starting guard, including a standout performance of 25pts and 7 3's. 
            Facing NCAA teams like SFU and WWU, I honed my skills. Now, having transitioned from player to coach, I'm eager to impart the wisdom I learned from top trainers and college teammates now turned pros.
             I'm committed to nurturing Maple Ridge's young talents, offering them a path to flourish in the game I cherish.</p>

        <h5>Assistant Coach & Athletic Development</h5>
        <p>Sports molded my identity from a young age. Despite lacking formal training, my natural talent stood out as I competed in youth soccer, as well as varsity football. Basketball, however, grew to become my true passion.
             I dedicated countless hours perfecting skills, excelling in defense and relentless pursuit. I focused strongly on my strength training to improve my athletic ability.
             Through Concrete Jungle Basketball, I aspire to inspire and empower the next generation with my expertise, fueled by an unyielding determination to succeed. </p>

        <h5>Assistant Coach & Athletic Development</h5>
        <p>
            Basketball has been my passion for 10 years. As a high school player, my team secured a Fraser Valley championship, 
            and I consistently competed at provincials. I've earned accolades like Defensive Player of the Year. 
            Now, as a mentor, I aim to nurture young athletes, imparting the wisdom I've gained from my athletic journey. 
            Understanding the profound influence of positivity, hard-work, and discipline, 
            I am motivated to guiding the next generation toward success, both on and off the court.</p>
